# Getting-and-cleaning-Data-Project-assignment
This is last assignment of third course in Data science specialization.In this project,I have presented a an R program which does the following:-
    Uses the library(reshape2),library(bitops),library(RCurl) to download the dataset in my C:/ directory and unzipping it to extract the dataset.
    Reads activity and features from he dataset
    Extracts the mean and standard deviation of features.
    Loads both the training and test data sets making only standard deviation and mean columns to appear
    Load the activiy data for each dataset
    loads the subjects for each data set
    Merge both the activity and subject columns
    Merges the dataets in 8 and 9 above
    Factorises the activity and subject columns by using the as.factor function
    produces a tidy dataset whose components are mean values for each subject and activity
    We are going to get a tidy datas called tidy.txt
